## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Backend (Flask + Playwright)
```
- Python 3.11+
- Flask web framework
- Playwright browser automation
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- BeautifulSoup HTML parsing
- Background job processing
- Rate limiting (2-3 second delays)
- Error handling and logging
```

### Frontend (React)
```
- React 18 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS styling
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide icons
- Real-time polling
- Responsive design
- Search and filtering
- Professional UI/UX
```

### Database Schema
```sql
Pages Table:
- page_id, page_name, status, last_scraped

Ads Table:
- library_id, page_id, ad_text, media_url
- media_type, start_date, cta, platforms

Jobs Table:
- id, page_ids, status, created_at
- started_at, completed_at, error_message
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. User Input
- User pastes Facebook Page IDs (one per line)
- System validates and creates scraping job
- Job is queued for background processing

### 2. Scraping Process
- Playwright launches Chromium browser
- Navigates to Facebook Ads Library for each page
- Handles infinite scrolling to load all ads
- Extracts ad data using CSS selectors
- Saves data to database with deduplication

### 3. Data Display
- Frontend polls API for real-time updates
- Users can search/filter through collected ads
- Professional dashboard shows statistics
- Export capabilities for further analysis

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

### Current Capabilities
- **Concurrent Processing**: One page at a time (prevents blocking)
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-3 second delays between requests
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes ads in batches
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries for fast search

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Easy migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis integration ready for API caching
- **Load Balancing**: Stateless design supports multiple instances
- **Queue System**: Can integrate Celery for distributed processing

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. No API Required
- Uses public Facebook Ads Library (no API keys needed)
- Respects rate limits and terms of service
- Accesses only publicly available data

### 2. Professional UI/UX
- Clean, modern interface similar to commercial spy tools
- Real-time job tracking and progress indicators
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Professional color scheme and typography

### 3. Robust Scraping Engine
- Handles dynamic content loading (infinite scroll)
- Extracts media URLs for images and videos
- Processes multiple ad formats and layouts
- Error recovery for network issues and page changes

### 4. Production Ready
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker containerization
- Multiple deployment options
- Security best practices
