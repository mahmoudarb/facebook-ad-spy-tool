## Facebook Ads Library Structure Analysis

**Initial Observations:**

*   The URL structure for a specific page ID is `https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=ALL&view_all_page_id=PAGE_ID`.
*   The page displays a list of ads for the given page ID.
*   Each ad card contains:
    *   Page name (e.g., 'Facebook' - visible at the top of the page, not per ad card)
    *   Ad media (video thumbnails observed, likely images as well)
    *   Primary ad text (e.g., 'Now, you can find every video youâ€™ve liked, shared, or saved...')
    *   Start date (e.g., 'Started running on Jul 29, 2025')
    *   Platforms (e.g., 'Platforms Facebook')
    *   A 'See ad details' button.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Click on 'See ad details' for an ad to investigate if more information (like CTA) is available on a detailed view.
2.  Identify how to extract ad media (image/video URLs).
3.  Determine how to handle pagination or infinite scrolling to get all ads for a page.
4.  Investigate filtering options and how they affect the URL or page content.



**Further Observations (after clicking 'See ad details' and scrolling):**

*   The 'See ad details' pop-up primarily shows the ad media and primary text, along with some basic ad information. It does not seem to contain a distinct CTA field that is easily extractable. The CTA might be embedded within the ad creative or primary text itself, or it might be a dynamic element that appears upon interaction.
*   The Facebook Ads Library uses infinite scrolling to load more ads. To scrape all ads for a given page ID, the scraper will need to simulate scrolling down until no new ads are loaded.
*   The ad cards display: 'Library ID', 'Started running on [Date]', 'Platforms' (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), and the primary ad text.
*   Ad media appears to be video thumbnails, but images are also likely. The URLs for these media assets will need to be extracted from the HTML.

**Revised Next Steps for Scraping:**

1.  Implement a scrolling mechanism to load all ads for a given page ID.
2.  Parse the HTML of each ad card to extract:
    *   Page name (this is consistent across the page, not per ad card).
    *   Ad media URL (image/video thumbnail).
    *   Primary ad text.
    *   Start date.
    *   Platforms.
    *   Investigate if CTA can be inferred from the primary ad text or by inspecting the ad creative more deeply.
3.  Consider the rate limits and potential blocking by Facebook when scraping a large number of pages/ads.
4.  Design a robust data structure to store the scraped information.
